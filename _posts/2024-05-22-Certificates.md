## Forensic Specialist
### Certified Secure
"The Forensic Specialist Specialty certification is specifically aimed at performing basic forensic investigations on a Linux server. The participant gains access to a “hacked” server and is tasked with securing the contents of the hard drive and then analyzing it. Based on this analysis, combined with monitoring network traffic, the identity of the “hackers” can be determined. Successful completion of the Forensic Specialist certification guarantees a basic understanding of network monitoring and forensic analysis."
